Author: Richard Braakman <dark@xs4all.nl>
Info: This script scans a binary package for scripts that start with #! and
 lists their filenames together with the interpreter named by their first line.
  The format is: scriptpath filename
 Note that the filename might contain spaces, but the scriptpath will not,
 because linux only looks at the first word when executing a script.
Type: binary, udeb
Needs-Info: unpacked, bin-pkg-control
Interface: exec
