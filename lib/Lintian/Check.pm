=head1 NAME

Lintian::Check -- Lintian checks shared between multiple scripts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lintian::Check qw(check_maintainer);

    my ($maintainer, $field) = ('John Doe', 'uploader');
    check_maintainer ($maintainer, $field);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides functions to do some Lintian checks that need to be
done in multiple places.  There are certain low-level checks, such as
validating a maintainer name and e-mail address or checking spelling,
which apply in multiple situations and should be done in multiple checks
scripts or in checks scripts and the Lintian front-end.

The functions provided by this module issue tags directly, usually either
taking the tag name to issue as an argument or dynamically constructing
the tag name based on function parameters.  The caller is responsible for
ensuring that all tags are declared in the relevant *.desc file with
proper descriptions and other metadata.  The possible tags issued by each
function are described in the documentation for that function.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item check_maintainer(MAINTAINER, FIELD)

Checks the maintainer name and address MAINTAINER for Policy compliance
and other issues.  FIELD is the context in which the maintainer name and
address was seen and should be one of C<maintainer> (the Maintainer field
in a control file), C<uploader> (the Uploaders field in a control file),
or C<changed-by> (the Changed-By field in a changes file).

The following tags may be issued by this function.  The string C<%s> in
the tags below will be replaced with the value of FIELD.

=over 4

=item %s-address-is-on-localhost

The e-mail address portion of MAINTAINER is at C<localhost> or some other
similar domain.

= item %s-address-is-root-user

The user (from email or username) of MAINTAINER is root.

=item %s-address-causes-mail-loops-or-bounces

The e-mail address portion of MAINTAINER or UPLOADER refers to the PTS
e-mail addresses  C<package@packages.debian.org> or
C<package@packages.qa.debian.org>, or, alternatively refers to a mailing
list which is known to bounce off-list mails sent by Debian role accounts.


=item %s-address-looks-weird

MAINTAINER may be syntactically correct, but it isn't conventionally
formatted.  Currently this tag is only issued for missing whitespace
between the name and the address.

=item %s-address-malformed

MAINTAINER doesn't fit the basic syntax of a maintainer name and address
as specified in Policy.

=item %s-address-missing

MAINTAINER does not contain an e-mail address in angle brackets (<>).

=item %s-name-missing

MAINTAINER does not contain a full name before the address, or the e-mail
address was not in angle brackets.

=item wrong-debian-qa-address-set-as-maintainer

MAINTAINER appears to be the Debian QA Group, but the e-mail address
portion is wrong for orphaned packages.  This tag is only issued for a
FIELD of C<maintainer>.

=item wrong-debian-qa-group-name

MAINTAINER appears to be the Debian QA Group, but the name portion is not
C<Debian QA Group>.  This tag is only issued for a FIELD of C<maintainer>.

=back

The last two tags are issued here rather than in a location more specific
to checks of the Maintainer control field because they take advantage of
the parsing done by the rest of the function.

    # <email>" (#640489).  Email::Valid->address (below) will accept
    # this in most cases (because that is generally valid), but we
    # only want Email::Valid to validate the "email" part and not the
    # name (Policy allows "." to be unquoted in names, Email::Valid
    # does not etc.).  Thus this check is to ensure we only pass the

=item spelling_tag_emitter(TAGNAME[, FILENAME])

Create and return a subroutine that is useful for emitting lintian
tags for spelling mistakes.  The returned CODE ref can be passed to
L</check_spelling(TEXT,[ EXCEPTIONS,] CODEREF)> and will faithfully
emit TAGNAME once for each unique spelling mistake.

The optional extra parameter FILENAME is used to denote the file name,
when this is not given from the tagname.

=item check_spelling(TEXT,[ EXCEPTIONS,] CODEREF)

Performs a spelling check of TEXT.  Call CODEREF once for each unique
misspelling with the following arguments:

=back

If EXCEPTIONS is given, it will be used as a hash ref of exceptions.
Any lowercase word appearing as a key of this hash ref will never be
considered a spelling mistake (exception being if it is a part of a
multiword misspelling).

Returns the number of spelling mistakes found in TEXT.
