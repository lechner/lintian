=head1 NAME

Lintian::Collect::Source - Lintian interface to source package data collection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my ($name, $type, $dir) = ('foobar', 'source', '/path/to/lab-entry');
    my $collect = Lintian::Collect->new ($name, $type, $dir);
    if ($collect->native) {
        print "Package is native\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lintian::Collect::Source provides an interface to package data for source
packages.  It implements data collection methods specific to source
packages.

This module is in its infancy.  Most of Lintian still reads all data from
files in the laboratory whenever that data is needed and generates that
data via collect scripts.  The goal is to eventually access all data about
source packages via this module so that the module can cache data where
appropriate and possibly retire collect scripts in favor of caching that
data in memory.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new (PACKAGE)

Creates a new Lintian::Collect::Source object.  Currently, PACKAGE is
ignored.  Normally, this method should not be called directly, only via
the Lintian::Collect constructor.

=cut

# Initialize a new source package collect object.  Takes the package name,
# which is currently unused.
sub new {
    my ($class, $pkg) = @_;
    my $self = {};
    bless($self, $class);
    return $self;
}

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

In addition to the instance methods listed below, all instance methods
documented in the L<Lintian::Collect> and L<Lintian::Collect::Package>
modules are also available.

=over 4

=item changelog

Returns the changelog of the source package as a Dpkg::Changelog::Debian
object, or C<undef> if the changelog cannot be resolved safely.

        $self->{changelog} = undef;
    }
    return $self->{changelog};
}

=item diffstat

Returns the path to diffstat output run on the Debian packaging diff
(a.k.a. the "diff.gz") for 1.0 non-native packages.  For source
packages without a "diff.gz" component, this returns the path to an
empty file (this may be a device like /dev/null).

    $dstat = '/dev/null' unless -e $dstat;
    $self->{diffstat} = $dstat;
    return $dstat;
}

=item native

Returns true if the source package is native and false otherwise.
This is generally determined from the source format, though in the 1.0
case the nativeness is determined by looking for the diff.gz (using
the name of the source package and its version).

If the source format is 1.0 and the version number is absent, this
will return false (as native packages are a lot rarer than non-native
ones).

Note if the source format is missing, it is assumed to be a 1.0
package.

A hash containing the contents of the JAR file manifest. For instance,

NB: Not all jar files have a manifest.  For those without, this will
value will not be available.  Use exists (rather than defined) to
check for it.

=item files

A table of the files in the JAR.  Each key is a file name and its value
is its "Major class version" for Java or "-" if it is not a class file.

=item error

If it exists, this is an error that occurred during reading of the zip
file.  If it exists, it is unlikely that the other fields will be

=item debfiles ([FILE])

B<This method is deprecated>.  Consider using
L<index_resolved_path(PATH)|Lintian::Collect::Package/index_resolved_path(PATH)>
instead, which returns L<Lintian::Path> objects.

Returns the path to FILE in the debian dir of the extracted source
package.  FILE must be relative to the root of the debian dir and
should be without leading slash (and without "./").  If FILE is
not in the debian dir, it returns the path to a non-existent file
entry.

It is not permitted for FILE to be C<undef>.  If the "root" dir is
desired either invoke this method without any arguments at all or use
the empty string.

The caveats of L<unpacked|Lintian::Collect::Package/unpacked ([FILE])>
also apply to this method.

=item index (FILE)

For the general documentation of this method, please refer to the
documentation of it in
L<Lintian::Collect::Package|Lintian::Collect::Package/index (FILE)>.

The index of a source package is not very well defined for non-native
source packages.  This method gives the index of the "unpacked"
package (with 3.0 (quilt), this implies patches have been applied).

If you want the index of what is listed in the upstream orig tarballs,
then there is L</orig_index>.

For native packages, the two indices are generally the same as they
only have one tarball and their debian packaging is included in that
tarball.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL/CAVEAT: Lintian currently (2.5.11) generates
this by running "find(1)" after unpacking the source package.
This has three consequences.

First it means that (original) owner/group data is lost; Lintian
inserts "root/root" here.  This is usually not a problem as
owner/group information for source packages do not really follow any
standards.

Secondly, permissions are modified by A) umask and B) laboratory
set{g,u}id bits (the laboratory on lintian.d.o has setgid).  This is
*not* corrected/altered.  Note Lintian (usually) breaks if any of the
"user" bits are set in the umask, so that part of the permission bit
I<should> be reliable.

Again, this shouldn't be a problem as permissions in source packages
are usually not important.  Though if accuracy is needed here,
L</orig_index> may used instead (assuming it has the file in
question).

Third, hardlinking information is lost and no attempt has been made
to restore it.
